Python implementation for Raspberry Pi Zero W e-paper status
display, [written up in my blog post](http://johnj.com/posts/e-paper-rpi-display/).

*Nota bene*: I did not follow [my usual
practices](http://johnj.com/posts/practices/) for this program, as it
was a quick hobby project meant as a proof-of-concept.
